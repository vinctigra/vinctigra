### Hi there 👋

I am passionate about the web and new technologies, I am fortunate to be able to train as a web developer at ENI Ecole Informatique as part of a professional reorientation <💻 />.

After 13 years in mass distribution where I experienced wonderful professional moments but also strong disappointments. I needed to take on this new challenge.

My life has always been marked by work, leisure and illness (and yes I have cystic fibrosis 🧬). I am active, I am always on the move, and am available to my loved ones who I don’t hesitate to help when they need it.

In my spare time I love to hang out with my friends playing PlayStation 🎮 (I'm often the squad leader 😂).

When the weather is good, with my wife, we go to the seaside to get away from it all, I take the opportunity to go snorkeling there 🤿 . I can't wait to introduce my daughter to the marine world 🐠 (and future dad in May 2021 👶🏻).

A world so beautiful and so calm when you dive into these abyss 🐟. And yet, if you only knew the number of bits of plastic that I pick up from the bottom of the sea… 🚯♻️

So I'll have a coffee ☕️ and get back to coding <💻 />.

Take a look 👀 at my online portfolio and resume to learn more about my professional background.
